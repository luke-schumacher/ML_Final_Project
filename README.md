Our Final project was aimed at making price predictions for stocks ranging from 5 days into the future to 1 month as well as 1 year predictions. The model we had most success with can be found in the "Random Forest Modelling" file. The PDF gives more precise background information about our project goals.

Apart from working with Yahoo Finance I have also worked with the Pima Diabetes for Classifiaction as well as the Wine Quality Dataset for Regression. With both of these data sets I have worked with RF models / Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Ada Boosting and Neural Networks.
